# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 1000 (from the original 50000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitby’s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

Reducing the number of repetitions in the simulation create more variations and randomness in the results, that would impact reproducibility. 

In order to ensure reporducibility, we need to set a random seed at the beginning of the simulation:

import random 
# Set random seed for reproducibility 

np.random.seed(123) 
random.seed(123)


# Run the simulation 1000 times
results = [simulate_event(m) for m in range(1000)]
props_df = pd.DataFrame(results, columns=["Infections", "Traces"])


The reason using a fixed random seed is to have the simulation have the same starting point for generating ta sequency of random numbers. Though the numbers shows random, they all derived from the initial seed value. All in all, it would ensure the consistency and let the results be replicated by others
